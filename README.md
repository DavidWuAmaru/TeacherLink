# TeacherLink
## Description
In the modern educational environment, communication between teachers and students is a crucial aspect of the learning process. However, traditional communication methods such as email or face-to-face interaction may present some inconveniences, such as difficulty in finding a teacher's email or time constraints. To address these issues, a mobile application named 「TeacherLink」 has been developed. It aims to facilitate communication between teachers and students, making tasks such as requesting leave and sending messages easier and more convenient.
